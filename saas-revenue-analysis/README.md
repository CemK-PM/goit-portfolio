<summary>📊 Tableau Project – SaaS User Behavior Dashboard (click to expand)</summary>

Developed a multi-layered Tableau dashboard visualizing the entire user funnel from initial app install through feature usage to final conversion, allowing stakeholders to identify weak points and optimize onboarding flow.

Implemented retention curve analysis across iOS and Android cohorts, leveraging session timestamps and activity flags to monitor 7-day and 30-day retention gaps, revealing critical drop-off periods.

Mapped the customer journey using interaction-based segmentation, enabling analysis of behavior by device type, user intent, and time-of-day activity peaks to guide personalized user strategies.

Integrated event-level Amplitude exports with Tableau to create real-time performance indicators, comparing daily active usage trends, bounce rates, and session lengths by platform and acquisition channel.

Designed an interactive dashboard experience with slicers and dynamic filters, allowing end users to segment by platform, engagement level, and usage frequency—facilitating self-service insights across departments.
