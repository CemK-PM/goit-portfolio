<summary>üßæ Project Overview - Click to read full description</summary>

This project focuses on analyzing the revenue performance and user monetization trends of a SaaS product using structured data from marketing campaigns and user behavior logs.

The goal was to create a complete picture of how marketing spend translates into paying users and recurring revenue over time. Using SQL, Tableau, and Google Sheets, I processed and visualized key performance indicators such as ARPPU, MRR, CPC, CTR, ROAS, and ROMI across different acquisition channels and campaigns.

The analysis began with a breakdown of paid user acquisition and its impact on revenue. Tableau dashboards were created to highlight geographic performance differences and monthly fluctuations in income. A cohort-based retention model was also implemented in Google Sheets to monitor long-term user engagement and identify where drop-offs occurred.

In parallel, SQL queries were developed to automate the extraction of advertising metrics from campaign-level data, enabling weekly reporting and performance comparisons across platforms.

The project serves as a full-cycle marketing analytics case, from data extraction to visualization and insight delivery, with a focus on business-relevant metrics and practical decision support for marketing teams.
